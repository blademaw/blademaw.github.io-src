Hi! — My name is Jack, and I'm an aspiring data scientist with a passion for computer science. 
I'm currently completing a Bachelor's degree of Computer Science
at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/){:target="_blank"}. When I'm not occupied with school,
I enjoy crafting side-projects that give me space to experiment and explore topics in data science
or computer science. Sometimes I end up uploading them to this blog and talking about them.
