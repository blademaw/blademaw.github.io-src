Choose a point on a circle. Then, imagine shooting out a bunch of "rays" to the circumference of the circle, measuring their lengths, and averaging them. Let's call this the _average radius_. At the center of the circle, this average would clearly just be the radius (one, in the case of the unit circle).

But what if we picked any other point within the circle? Surely it wouldn't matter â€” the average radius would just be the radius, because the circle is symmetrical: the shorter distances to the circumferences would be averaged out by the larger ones! Right? ...right?
