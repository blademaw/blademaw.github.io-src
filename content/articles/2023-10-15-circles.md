<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Choose a point on a circle. Then, imagine shooting out a bunch of "rays" to the circumference of the circle, measuring their lengths, and averaging them. Let's call this the "average radius." At the center of the circle, this average would clearly just be the radius.

But what if we picked any other point within the circle? Surely it wouldn't matter â€” the average radius would just be the radius because of the circle's symmetry: the shorter distances to the circumferences would be averaged out by the larger ones! Right? ...right?
