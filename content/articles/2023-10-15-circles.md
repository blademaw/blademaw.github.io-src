The radius of a circle is defined as the distance from the circle's center to any point on its circumference. If you move the point of measurement to be off-center (as in the figure above), the distances to the circle's circumference are no longer all equal to the circle's radius. But what if you took the mean all of those individual distancesâ€”would you recover the value of the radius?

In this post, I discuss how for any off-center point within a circle:

- averaging the distances from the point to the circle's circumference yields a value strictly larger than the circle's radius; and
- averaging the distances that pass through the chosen point from one side of the circle to the other yields a value strictly smaller than the circle's diameter.
