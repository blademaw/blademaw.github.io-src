Choose any point on a circle, imagine shooting out a bunch of "rays" from the point to the circumference, and then averaging their lengths — let's call this the _average radius_. If the origin of the rays is the center of the circle (as in the figure on the left), this average would just be the radius of the circle.

But what if we picked any other point within the circle (e.g., the figure on the right)? Surely it wouldn't matter — the average radius would just be the radius, because the circle is symmetrical: the shorter distances to the circumferences would be averaged out by the larger ones! Right? ...right?

It turns out that this is not the case, and the chosen point of origin for the "average radius" produces a number very different from the actual radius of the circle.
