In this post, I'd like to (perhaps overly) analyze a pretty simple problem, and explore a few routes of answering it through analytic solutions and simulation. This problem actually came from a very enjoyable class I took called _Computational Modeling and Simulation_, which taught me (among many other things) the beauty of simulation, stochastic processes, and dynamical systems. \*\***I have also obtained permission to use the question as a case study**\*\*.
