In many quantitative disciplines, problems can often be framed as the task of finding the value — or set of values — that make some expression equal zero. For example, we may want to find the theoretical break-even point of a firm (when profit is equal to zero) or under what conditions a dynamical system is at equilibrium (when the rate of change of the system is zero).
