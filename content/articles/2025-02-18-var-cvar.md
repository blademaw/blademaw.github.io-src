At its core, financial risk management is concerned with quantifying potential losses to assess the downside of financial endeavors and prepare for worst-case scenarios. Perhaps the two most salient risk measures in the field of risk management are **value at risk** (VaR) and **expected shortfall**, also known as **conditional value at risk** (CVaR). Using statistical underpinnings, these measures estimate the probabilistic maximal loss of a portfolio over a given time period.
