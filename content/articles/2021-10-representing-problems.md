<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
In this blog post, I want to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about **representing problems** — a process any CS student must first fully internalize before advancing to complex problem solving. To seasoned problem-solvers, the process of problem representation is so natural that us onlookers are quick to take the process for granted. In this blog post, I'd like to look at three case studies — two of which are puzzles from the gold mine _[The PuzzlOR](http://puzzlor.com/)_, and the third is the classic N-Queens problem.
